"Temperature": "First, a summary of the temperature-related climate vulnerabilities for different energy assets is provided. Temperature is generally the most widely available and accurate climate data type, with reliable global datasets that extend well into the past and station data going back to the 19th century or earlier. Temperature data are vital for understanding customer demand and resource adequacy, especially at the hourly scale. Temperature extremes may have an important impact on energy infrastructure, with each asset facing unique challenges based on its operational needs and environmental exposure. Despite existing uncertainties and data gaps, temperature data remains essential. For instance, hourly temperature observations are more common in developed and densely populated regions, while they are limited in less developed or sparsely populated areas. Additionally, many temperature observations are not publicly accessible or may require a fee for access. Although most Global Climate Models (GCMs) provide daily maximum, mean, and minimum temperatures, they often do not include the hourly or sub-hourly values that are critical for real-time operations and resource planning. Furthermore, hourly simulated temperatures are generally available only through statistical or dynamical downscaling methods, which can limit their usability for immediate decision-making.",
"Liquid precipitation": "Liquid precipitation (i.e. rainfall) is essential for understanding weather patterns across meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological domains. It is crucial for assessing hydropower resource availability and can also be broadly used to evaluate drought and flood conditions. In terms of uncertainties related to data availability and accuracy, weather station observations and gridded datasets are available for precipitation on sub-daily and daily timescales; however, the accuracy of rainfall estimates, particularly during extreme events, can be influenced by local station conditions, spatial distribution of point measurements, and weather factors (e.g., under-catchment due to wind or under-measurement due to evaporation). These uncertainties impact the representation of precipitation and the resolution of gridded products. Gridded products also integrate weather models with observations, meaning that the resolution of the underlying model can affect the accuracy in capturing extreme events. For example, precipitation varies significantly over short distances, especially near steep topography, so large estimation errors should be expected in regions with low station density and/or highly variable topography. In the same manner, round-based weather radars are the most effective tools for estimating precipitation remotely due to their high spatial and temporal resolution and continuous spatial coverage. However, radar data are unavailable for many regions and are less accurate further from radar installations. Other important observation for data quality improvement is that satellite products provide near-global precipitation data for recent decades but are indirect and estimates of intensity and duration tend to be less accurate than surface observations, particularly at the polar regions. Towards this direction enhanced precipitation algorithms are needed to improve detection of heavy precipitation events, which are critical from an operational perspective. Also, gridded precipitation products, like IMERG, help fill spatial and temporal data gaps by assimilating in-situ, radar, and satellite data, offering higher accuracy than reanalysis products (e.g., ERA5). However, they are limited by the length of available records (starting around 2000). In parallel, there is a need to improve simulations of historical and projected global precipitation patterns in Global Climate Models. Users should consult an expert to understand the uncertainties and fitness-for-use of these models.",
"Frozen precipitation": "Frozen precipitation (e.g. snowfall, freezing rain, ice) can have a range of operational impacts and can also pose physical hazards to power system infrastructure. Freezing rain can accumulate on trees, making them more susceptible to falling, and on transmission and distribution infrastructure producing power outages. It also coats wind turbine blades greatly reducing aerodynamic lift, and thus output, as well as creating hazardous operating conditions due to ice throw. Snowfall can cause similar, albeit typically less severe, issues on infrastructure and when it accumulates on solar panels can reduce output to zero. Accumulated snowpack is critical for optimizing hydrological operations on scales from days to months because it acts as hydrological storage. Again, there is a set of parameters that can affect the data available for frozen precipitation measurements and cause uncertainties in understanding the effects of this climate variable. These are a) limited observational data: unlike rainfall, snowfall and other types of frozen precipitation are less densely observed. Where data are available, radar, especially when combined with temperature and ground-station precipitation data, can provide valuable insights into the type and intensity of frozen precipitation. b) gridded snowfall datasets: these datasets are often provided in liquid equivalents, requiring the application of snowfall ratios to convert to actual snowfall amounts. c) freezing rain observations: freezing rain is typically recorded through point-based reports (e.g., storm event databases). These observations are not continuous, making it challenging to reconstruct the extent and magnitude of freezing rain events accurately. d) gridded data limitations: gridded datasets contain hourly precipitation and precipitation-type variables that can estimate hourly freezing precipitation. However, these estimates are approximate, as gridded data are often coarse and may not accurately capture physical drivers of freezing rain, such as warm air inversions.",
"Wind speeds and directions": "Wind speeds and directions are important to understand occurrences of physical hazards such as wind gusts that may damage infrastructure, and drive wildfire, as well as for assessing wind resource availability. Wind speed and direction observations vary across different environments and data sources. Near-surface wind speeds are typically measured at 10 meters above ground level by surface stations, although these records tend to be shorter in duration compared to temperature data. In coastal and offshore areas, observations are limited, primarily relying on sparse buoy data and occasional scatterometer readings, particularly outside of wind farm zones. Wind gusts, which represent short bursts of high wind speeds, are critical for assessing potential damage; however, accurately estimating these gusts poses challenges due to environmental interactions and the limitations of available data resolution. Publicly available data for hub-height winds, which are essential for wind turbine operation, is scarce, with most information coming from proprietary sources such as lidar, sodar, or turbine nacelles. Reanalysis data products, such as ERA5, tend to correlate well with onshore measurements but exhibit reduced accuracy in complex terrains and demonstrate errors in offshore conditions. To enhance precision in intricate areas, high-resolution downscaled reanalysis data has been developed; however, access to these datasets is often limited, with commercial sources typically providing longer datasets for purchase.",
"Drought": "Droughts can be impactful to the power sector, but the impacts differ depending on the type of drought (meteorological, agricultural, hydrological). Meteorological drought refers to a lack of rainfall or dry conditions as measured by the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration over a defined period of time. Data gaps for meteorological drought are related to precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) data gaps, which together drive the atmospheric water balance. ET is one of the most data-limited climate variables due to lack of technology to take measurements over wide regions. In general, evaporation is influenced by microclimatological features that are spatially variable, like surface roughness and land-use/land-cover. Additionally, he drivers of plant transpiration also suffer from data limitations. Direct observations of ET are very sparse, expensive, and are generally only used to calibrate and validate ET models. Remote sensing-based ET estimations rely on water balance models, energy balance models, or vegetation indices, which all suffer from various basis and uncertainties. There is critical need to improve ET estimations to improve estimates of all hydrological and hydrometeorological variables. However, data gaps persist due to a lack of direct measurements, challenges in large-scale estimations, and reliance on models that are difficult and costly to parameterise. These models require a wide range of climate data, including soil moisture, vegetation characteristics, solar radiation, and other microclimatological factors. Furthermore, feature projections of reference and potential ET are available for a range of CMIP6 models and scenarios, but improvements are essential for enhancing the reliability of ET projections.",
"Flooding": "Flooding information is important to understand present and future physical hydrological conditions that can pose hazards to power system infrastructure and operations. Data on inland flooding significantly overlaps with hydrological drought, highlighting the interconnectedness of these phenomena. Along coastal areas, storm-tide, surface water level, and water quality gauges provide valuable information on storm surges. Recent advancements in satellite sensors have enhanced the availability of flood inundation observations, although these observations still have limited sub-daily temporal coverage. In contrast, global and regional models can offer useful estimates of hourly or sub-daily streamflow. To improve the accuracy of flood condition assessments, there is a pressing need to increase the number of gauges in the hydrological monitoring network. Additionally, more observational data on debris flow, sedimentation, and erosion resulting from floods after wildfires are necessary, especially as wildfire risks have escalated in recent decades. Projections of inland and coastal flooding are available from several vendors, though detailed asset-level projections are often behind a paywall, and these projections are primarily influenced by anticipated changes in precipitation.",
"Wildfires": "Wildfires are extreme events that have the potential to devastate local infrastructure and the natural environment. Antecedent wildfire conditions often place aging transmission and distribution infrastructure at risk of igniting fires due to wind related damage, which can place extreme liability risk on the responsible utility. The smoke from wildfires can also dramatically reduce solar outputs across a wide area even during clear sky conditions in regions well away from the fire. Coupling smoke transport models with photovoltaic production models could provide greater insight into the spatial, (e.g. proximity to fire) and temporal (e.g. timing and magnitude of smoke-related reductions) impacts of wildfire smoke on PV generation. Wildfire data are important to better understand these extreme events and pre- and post-wildfire data are useful in characterizing wildfire risks and associated impacts. Understanding wildfire data is crucial for characterizing these extreme events and assessing their impacts. Reliable global observations of wildfires, including locations and perimeters, have only been available since the onset of the satellite era in the 1970s. While previous wildfire records exist, they are often incomplete and vary geographically. Even in the satellite era, scientists typically track only 'large wildfires' (those greater than 500 or 1,000 acres) due to challenges in inventorying smaller fires from space. Furthermore, spatial, and temporal gaps mean that wildfires are not continuously monitored. There is a pressing need for improvements in satellite-based indices, particularly hyperspectral imaging, to detect wildfires, measure their intensity, differentiate wildfire events from cloud and smoke cover, and assess burned vegetation. Enhancements are also required in remote sensing techniques to characterise fuel types, structures, and moisture content for evaluating pre-fire hazard potential. Moreover, there is a lack of open-source wildfire data at higher resolutions, such as the asset or property level, and air quality monitoring networks must be improved to enhance observations. While future projections of fire weather are available in some areas, there is a need for models that account for factors beyond just fire weather, including fuel loads, land use, and human activities such as settlement in the wildland-urban interface and fire management practices. Currently, modeled wildfire projections are available for specific regions and wider spatial extents from various sources, but these are often limited to a select few emissions scenarios or future years.",
"Extreme weather events": "Extreme weather events include severe and unusual weather phenomena such as hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires that significantly exceed the typical patterns of a region. These events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, often resulting in widespread damage to ecosystems, infrastructure, and communities. Tropical cyclones and hurricanes can severely damage infrastructure, affecting consumer demand, power delivery, and overall operations. Although tornadoes, lightning, and hail are smaller-scale extreme events, they can still inflict substantial damage on local power system infrastructure and operations. Analysing the data gap uncertainties, it is important to note that tropical cyclones are typically not well resolved in global climate models, making their simulation challenging due to limitations in model capabilities, the length of the observational record, and uncertainties in observations. While some tools have been developed to simulate the expected frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones across various basins under future climate projections, improvements are needed in the form of higher resolution models and downscaling approaches. Historical data for severe storms is largely based on reports from weather observers, and although radar imagery is valuable for diagnosing storm characteristics, gaps in radar coverage may limit its effectiveness as an indicator of surface weather. Human observations or reports are often required for verification. Tornado data relies on human reports and is formalised through surveys conducted by the National Weather Service. The reporting process has evolved over time due to changes in population and advances in remote sensing technology, such as radar, which have led to an increase in the reporting of smaller (e.g., EF0) and more remote tornadoes. Generally, tornado data only provides information about the start and end locations of the event, making comprehensive analysis more difficult.",
"Lightning": "Lightning can have significant impacts on electric grid infrastructures by causing power outages, equipment damage, and disruptions. Direct lightning strikes can damage transformers, transmission lines, and substations, while power surges from nearby strikes can cause failures, leading to costly repairs and downtime. In terms of uncertainty caused by data availability, it should be noted that specific lighting data is not available for all places and does not usually contain long-term records as measurements started in modern times. Also, in some cases, data is not available to the public as it is tracked and stored by a company or other private entity."
