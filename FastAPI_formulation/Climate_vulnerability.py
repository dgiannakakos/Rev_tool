Additionally, changes in temperature can alter the frequency and intensity of precipitation events, such as rain-on-snow, which are crucial for water management.",
    "Liquid precipitation": "Excessive precipitation can challenge the capacity of dams to handle increased water flow without overtopping. Hydroelectric plants must manage this excess water through a combination of power generation and water spillage over spillways to prevent dam failure.",
    "Frozen precipitation": "Winter storms can severely disrupt operations by causing ice formation on electromechanical equipment and spillway gates. If not adequately managed, ice can lead to operational inefficiencies and increased maintenance demands.",
    "Drought": "Under low precipitation conditions, facilities must modify how they operate as this precipitation acts as the “fuel” which powers the plant. These modifications will be subject to a combination of site-specific requirements such as revenue (resulting in shifting operations from base load type generation to peaking type generation to Maximise revenue per energy produced), ability to temporarily alter flow requirements with regulatory agencies, and the role that the plant plays in meeting generation requirements.",
    "Wind speeds and directions": "While changes in wind patterns generally have minimal direct effects on hydroelectric operations, extreme wind conditions can pose safety risks and necessitate additional maintenance efforts to secure plant operations and infrastructure.",
    "Flooding": "Flooding poses significant risks, impairing the plant's ability to generate electricity and provide flood control services. Inadequate gantry crane layouts and spillway designs may struggle to manage excessive water flow, increasing the risk of spillway overflow and associated damages.",

"Electrical grid assets": {
"Circuit breakers and gas-insulated systems/gas-insulated buses": {
    "Temperature": "The combination of cold external housings and warmer internal conductors can cause uneven aging in circuit breaker systems. In extremely cold conditions, such as a polar vortex or deep freeze, SF6 gas inside the equipment can liquefy, which typically occurs around -20°C at a pressure of 6.5 bar. This liquefaction weakens the insulating properties of SF6, potentially leading to malfunctioning breakers. To prevent this, mixed gases can be used, but this may require derating of the equipment. Cold temperatures can also thicken lubricants, slow circuit breaker operation, and cause icing inside control cabinets, further reducing equipment reliability.",
    "Liquid precipitation": "Variations in precipitation, including particulates, salt, and acidification, can accelerate corrosion and reduce the lifespan of external components, potentially leading to conductivity issues. If particles enter the system, they can cause arcing or through-faults. Additionally, the foundations of circuit breakers and GIS/GIB  systems may be vulnerable to spalling, especially when affected by contaminants or poor construction practices.",
    "Frozen precipitation": "Increased snow and ice buildup can create cold zones, raising concerns about gas liquefaction in circuit breakers. The accumulation also affects external operating mechanisms, potentially preventing equipment from functioning properly. Ice formation at conductor-insulator interfaces can reduce electrical clearance or create a conductive path, leading to faults. Additionally, heavy ice buildup can stress components like porcelain insulators, steel frames, and connectors, which may break under the weight when frozen.",
    "Wind speeds and directions": "Strong wind gusts can wear down components of circuit breakers and GIS/GIB systems, leading to issues like worn seals, cracked joints, corrosion, and increased SF6 leaks. Wind can cause equipment misalignment and shorter ground distances, potentially leading to faults. Continuous high winds can also deform connections, intensify water ingress, and abrade surfaces with particulates like sand and dirt. Equipment can shift due to soil erosion caused by wind and rain, while gusts can lead to through-faults, downed lines, and damage from falling trees or debris. Wind-driven vibrations may loosen or break connections, heightening the risk of electrical faults. Moreover, SF6, a potent greenhouse gas, may be released due to damage, contributing to climate change. Alternatives to SF6 are available, but some produce harmful byproducts, such as cyanide gas. High humidity and wind can also lead to ice buildup, causing further damage, including SF6 condensation or hazardous falling ice.",
    "Flooding": "Flooding from heavy rain or storm surges presents significant risks, especially for equipment near coastlines. Rising sea levels and increased storm surges may require relocating some equipment to avoid frequent or permanent submersion. Saltwater exposure can worsen corrosion and conductivity concerns, especially for lower-ground equipment like transformers and electrical cabinets, even though circuit breakers are often elevated. Floodwaters may also hinder emergency repairs by preventing adequate grounding. Furthermore, under increased storm loads, equipment with low duty ratings may struggle to handle the extra demand.",
    "Wildfires": "Even if wildfires don’t directly reach circuit breaker or GIS/GIB equipment, the heat can raise internal temperatures, affecting gases and damaging components like gauges or connections. Wildfires also produce smoke and soot, which can cover equipment surfaces with conductive or corrosive particles. Before settling, soot-filled air can become ionised, increasing the risk of arcing between equipment. Fire retardants used to combat wildfires pose additional risks to station equipment, though their specific effects on circuit breakers, bushings, and connectors are not well understood. As wildfires become more frequent, the use of fire retardants will increase, requiring further study to ensure compatibility with substation equipment."
    },
"Substation equipment": {
    "Temperature": "Rising ambient temperatures can lead to capacity losses and increased failure rates in substation components, causing reliability issues. High temperatures and loads can result in thermal expansion and metal fatigue in rigid buses, damaging components. Prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures can cause annealing, which weakens conductors, particularly affecting the maximum temperature limits of bushings and switch terminals during summer with added loads. Certain components, like surge arresters and bushings with high dissipation factors, may experience thermal runaway at elevated temperatures, compromising their performance. Additionally, rising temperatures can reduce the transfer capability of buses and connections to transmission lines, accelerating the aging of components due to heat loss.",
    "Liquid precipitation": "Erosion from heavy rainfall can damage structural supports, fencing, and soil. Acid rain worsens the situation by depositing airborne contaminants on equipment, causing corrosion, reduced insulation capacity, and increasing the risk of insulator flashover. Polluted air dissolved in rain or fog can further reduce air's insulation strength, while acidic residues corrode metal fittings, towers, and conductors, potentially leading to equipment failure and flashovers from rust particles carried by wind to insulator surfaces.",
    "Frozen precipitation": "In cold weather combined with high humidity, rain, and wind, ice buildup on equipment surfaces can lead to significant issues. Accumulated ice and snow add weight to components like busbars, arresters, and switches, increasing mechanical stress and potentially causing breakage in support structures. This ice accumulation also expands the equipment's cross-sectional area, making it more susceptible to wind drag, which can increase mechanical strain. Ice formation can also create conductive paths, heightening the risk of flashover faults, especially if the surfaces are contaminated. Icing of disconnect switches can prevent the isolation of specific station sections, hindering maintenance activities and applying proper grounding. Additionally, road salt used during snowstorms can degrade the electrical strength of nearby insulators, leading to pollution-induced flashovers. Snow and ice accumulation on insulators can bridge gaps, further increasing the risk of electrical faults.",
    "Wind speeds and directions": "Increased intensity and frequency of winds can lead to faults and damage from debris, structural collapse, and physical strain on components like cables, bushings, and control cabinet doors. Winds can also cause external monitoring equipment to sway, leading to leaks in pipes and connections. Strong winds can exacerbate soil erosion, damaging equipment foundations. They increase wear and stress on bus systems, particularly during overloads, and can deform seals and connections, resulting in leaks or lubrication loss. Severe winds may damage transmission equipment, causing faults that interrupt utility services. Overhead components like busbars and disconnect switches can become loose or break under increased motion, while wind-blown debris can harm equipment surfaces. Wind-driven rain increases the risk of water ingress into control cabinets and connectors, which can lead to failures in arresters and insulators. Moisture often enters through metal diaphragms or aging rubber seals, leading to corrosion or cracks. While wind generally cools equipment, excessive power transmission can lead to overheating of connection lines, causing sagging and increasing the risk of contact with other conductive surfaces. Cooling winds can also tighten the anchor lines, stressing the equipment and potentially causing breaks. If accompanied by rain, cooling winds may lead to ice buildup, restricting equipment movement and creating conductive bridges. Strong winds can drive water into cracks and seals, and ice formation can exacerbate these issues by widening gaps, allowing for further water ingress and damage.",
    "Flooding": "Rapid water rise or sudden releases, like cloud bursts, pose significant flood risks to ground-level substation equipment, including control cubicles, switchgear, insulators, circuit breakers, transformers, and lightning arresters. Flooding can cause severe damage, particularly to low-voltage switchgear and control systems. Persistent flooding from increased precipitation or rising sea levels can lead to more frequent arrester operations, shortening their lifespan, while moisture ingress remains the primary cause of arrester failures globally.",
    "Wildfires": "Smoke from these fires can create faults by depositing conductive particles on substation equipment, leading to service interruptions. Additionally, smoke contains corrosive compounds that can damage paints and metals, while particles may obstruct the mechanisms of exposed mechanical switches, such as disconnect devices. Even if the fire does not directly reach the substation equipment, the heat generated can still harm connected components like gauges, bushings, switches, and conductors.",
    "Lightning": "Lightning is a significant cause of power outages. Strong and continuous lightning strikes on or near overhead buses can lead to short-circuit faults, resulting in increased wear from the mechanical forces generated by fault currents. These faults can activate electrical protective equipment, disconnecting lines if lightning strikes conductors. Additionally, voltage surges from lightning can travel along lines and damage equipment such as insulators, arrestors, and instrumentation. When lightning strike energy exceeds design limits, it can overload arresters’ internal dielectrics, leading to immediate failure. With more frequent and severe storms, cumulative damage to arresters may arise from an increased number of lower-magnitude lightning strikes."
    },
"Distribution automation assets": {
    "Temperature": "1) Elevated Air Temperature: Projected increases in ambient air temperatures will worsen the conditions for operating sensitive electronic equipment and batteries housed in enclosures on power lines and pad-mounted equipment. For instance, the proper functioning of a recloser relies on its backup battery, which can lose half its service life for every 8°C increase above 25°C. Additionally, higher temperatures, along with changing precipitation patterns, may promote greater vegetation growth. This increased growth could lead to more faults, causing reclosers to operate more frequently and endure additional stress on their vacuum interrupter and mechanical actuation systems due to the heightened demand. 2) Low Air Temperature: Sudden temperature fluctuations during certain events can result in mechanical failures of automation assets. For instance, repeated expansion and contraction of epoxy molds due to rapid temperature shifts have previously led to significant failures. Additionally, during extreme cold weather, de-icing agents like salt and brine are often used on urban roadways, which can accumulate on pad-mounted automation equipment and controls, leading to corrosion and degradation of components.",
    "Liquid precipitation": "The anticipated increase in precipitation may exacerbate problems related to moisture ingress in all automation asset components, including the control enclosure, the cable connecting the control to the pole-top device, and the pole-top devices themselves. This moisture ingress can ultimately lead to operational issues and the rapid deterioration of critical recloser components.",
    "Drought": "In regions experiencing extreme drought, contaminants can accumulate on the surfaces of bushings and other components, potentially compromising insulation as rain is absent to wash them away. Additionally, UV radiation, especially on hot, clear days typical of drought conditions, can speed up the degradation of the materials used in automation assets. It will be essential to incorporate effective UV inhibitors into these materials to mitigate this risk.",
    "Flooding": "Flooding—resulting from heavy rainfall, storm surges, rising sea levels, or other factors—has caused instances where automation controls are submerged, even though the devices themselves remain unaffected. However, when flood damage occurs, it renders the devices inoperable due to damage to the controls, resulting in unreliable operation and control failures.",
    "Lightning": "The anticipated rise in lightning frequency poses a significant risk to automation assets, as lightning is a frequent cause of recloser failures. To safeguard long-term recloser performance during such events, it's crucial to use surge arresters and monitor their condition effectively."
    },
"Overhead distribution systems": {
    "Temperature": "1) Elevated Air Temperature: Global electricity consumption is projected to grow, requiring distribution lines to carry more power. This will result in higher load currents and increased local generation, pushing distribution systems beyond their current capacity. Higher loads will lead to elevated operating temperatures for transformers and conductors, accelerating their degradation and increasing the likelihood of failure. Additionally, rising ambient temperatures will make it harder for equipment to dissipate heat, reducing the current-carrying capacity of overhead infrastructure and compounding the issue. In regions where wind speeds decrease, which normally assist in cooling equipment, these problems may worsen. Many distribution systems, built decades ago, lack the capacity to handle these demands, and inadequate infrastructure will need more frequent inspection, maintenance, and replacement. Warmer temperatures will also accelerate the degradation of other assets, such as surge arresters, which are prone to thermal runaway. Wood poles may decay faster as microbial activity increases with higher temperatures and humidity, though regions with drier conditions may see slower degradation. Warmer climates will also accelerate vegetation growth, increasing the risk of encroachment on overhead lines and leading to more frequent tree trimming. 2) Low Air Temperature: Some distribution assets are particularly vulnerable to temperature variations, especially due to freeze/thaw cycles. When moisture seeps into gaps and pores, freezing can cause expansion, creating stresses that damage components. This is already seen in porcelain-insulated products like fuse cutouts, which have experienced fractures leading to outages. As freeze/thaw cycles become more frequent, this issue may worsen, particularly in regions that previously had fewer such events. Low temperatures combined with precipitation can also lead to icing, which may become problematic in areas not historically affected by it. Ice buildup can increase pole loading and accumulate on tree branches, causing them to lean into or fall onto overhead lines, leading to mechanical or electrical faults.",
    "Wind speeds and directions": "Overhead distribution lines are increasingly vulnerable to damage from higher wind loading, especially in aging infrastructure. As wind speed and duration rise, the force on poles and attached components intensifies. Poles must support wind loads acting on conductors, telecommunication lines, equipment, and the poles themselves.",
    "Flooding": "Hurricanes and heavy rain often cause flooding that can weaken or erode the soil supporting the poles.",
    "Wildfires": "Wildfires pose a threat as many pole materials are flammable, making them susceptible to fire damage.",
    "Extreme weather events": "Hurricanes produce high, sustained winds and gusts that impose heavy loads on poles, often leading to damage or breakage. Debris, including large branches and building materials, can exacerbate this risk.",
    "Lightning": "Due to climate change, lightning frequency may rise, necessitating adjustments in insulation standards, arrester sizing and usage, as well as increased focus on ground resistance."
    },
"Underground distribution systems": {
    "Temperature": "Managing heat generation and dissipation is essential for the reliability of electric energy delivery systems. The complex relationship between load currents and heat in cable systems and transformers is challenging to predict. Current dielectric materials begin to soften at temperatures between 125–130°C, while older oil-paper insulations degrade above 85°C. Although most systems operate below these damaging temperatures, climate change is increasing load demands, leading to higher operating temperatures and reduced heat dissipation capabilities. This scenario may accelerate degradation in cables, transformers, and underground components due to increased moisture and corrosion risks. Elevated temperatures can also dry surrounding soil, further limiting heat transfer. Utilities face challenges in predicting load and heating dynamics, necessitating safety factors to ensure operational limits are maintained. Ultimately, excessive heating can compromise the insulation materials, weakening the entire system's integrity.",
    "Frozen precipitation": "During cold weather events, local governments often implement de-icing measures on major roadways using chemicals like salt and brine. These substances can deteriorate underground components, such as cable accessory sealing mastics, metallic shields, and transformer enclosures, potentially leading to increased failures. For instance, damage to the system's neutral could raise step potential around cable systems, posing public safety risks. Additionally, degraded transformer tanks may develop oil leaks, harming the environment. Furthermore, rising daily low winter temperatures could lead to more frequent freeze/thaw cycles, which may shorten the lifespan of underground conduits, vaults, and other infrastructure.",
    "Flooding": "Flooding poses a significant risk, as exposed voltage contacts on these devices may short-circuit when exposed to floodwaters, whether from heavy rainfall or long-term inundation due to rising sea levels.",
    "Wildfires": "Many underground distribution systems are primarily located below ground, especially in urban areas, but they often incorporate above-ground components such as pole risers and pad-mounted equipment (switches and transformers). These above-ground elements are vulnerable to storm and wildfire damage."
    },
"Large power transformers": {
    "Temperature": "1) Elevated Air Temperature: High temperatures limit transformer capacity by raising winding hot spot and oil temperatures, reducing operational efficiency. Higher ambient temperatures speed up aging and degradation of transformer components, shortening their lifespan. Extreme heat can also raise residential and commercial cooling demands by 10–20%, exceeding the original system specifications and stressing transmission systems. Elevated temperatures degrade materials like cellulose insulation, plastics, and rubber, even during temporary heat spikes. Higher temperatures cause faster degradation of key components, leading to more frequent maintenance and reducing the window for preventive upkeep during high-demand periods. Finally, rising electrical demand from devices like air conditioners can cause additional heating and stress due to higher harmonics and resonance, requiring more maintenance. 2) Low Air Temperature: Extreme weather can increase the viscosity of transformer insulating fluids, impairing heat transfer. Mineral oils typically have a pour point of -40°C, while some ester-based fluids may have a higher pour point of -20°C. In outage scenarios, fluids can gel or solidify, creating voids in insulation that pose dielectric risks and necessitate special cold start procedures. High moisture levels in oil can lead to condensation on insulation surfaces in cold temperatures, further increasing dielectric risks. In areas with electric heating, cold weather can raise transformer loads due to increased demand, especially if traditional power sources are compromised. This requires flexibility in the bulk transmission system to handle surge demand during outages, which can overload transformers. Additionally, low temperatures can affect electronic monitoring and protection devices, limiting visibility into transformer status and potentially causing misoperations that lead to unintended outages or equipment damage.",
    "Liquid precipitation": "Extreme rainfall over larger watersheds can cause flash flooding in areas that typically do not experience it. Additionally, rising sea levels may elevate water tables, potentially affecting underground components that were not designed for frequent or permanent flooding. As a result, substations that were previously considered safe may need enhancements to withstand potential inundation.",
    "Frozen precipitation": "Icing on bushings can worsen with contamination or frozen salt spray, raising the risk of flashover due to ice and frost accumulation. In regions prone to icing, it may be necessary to reassess specifications for creep distances of bushings and insulators. Heavy snow accumulation can obstruct access to equipment, reduce electrical clearances, and restrict movement around energised areas to maintain safety distances. In areas with extreme snowfall, substations may need to elevate apparatus to accommodate deep snowpacks. As climate change increases snow accumulation beyond historical levels, additional mitigation measures may be essential. Ice and snow can also block or freeze pressure relief devices, hindering their function during internal faults and potentially causing more extensive damage. For hydroelectric facilities, avalanches pose an additional risk, particularly for high-altitude sites located at the base of watersheds, where they can funnel water and debris towards critical infrastructure.",
    "Wind speeds and directions": "High winds can also directly damage power transformers through wind-driven debris and can impact nearby substation components linked by leads or strain bus. This can create excessive cantilever loads on high-voltage bushings, causing permanent damage that necessitates replacement. Furthermore, sustained high winds may lead to structural fatigue in insulators and conduit connections to transformers, weakening them over time. Additionally, fretting corrosion, which includes fretting fatigue and fretting wear, can occur due to wire tension or wind loads, movement, and rust formation.",
    "Drought": "Drought and water scarcity are increasingly significant challenges in various regions. For utility companies, prolonged low humidity, combined with heat and UV radiation, can lead to the degradation of polymer components, such as bushings, cable covers, and paints. In dry areas, there is often an increase in dust and debris, which can abrade surfaces and deposit conductive materials on transformers. While some polymers, like polystyrene and PTFE, are not significantly affected by humidity, hygroscopic polymers (which absorb moisture) depend on humidity to maintain flexibility and elasticity. Dry conditions can necessitate more frequent maintenance to prevent polymer failure and can shorten the lifespan of these components. Additionally, drought can lead to soil erosion, causing transformers and related components to shift positions. This movement increases the risk of faults or shorts, potentially resulting in transformer failure and the need for replacement. Moreover, dry conditions can lead to vegetation die-off, which can heighten wildfire risks near substations, posing further threats to the infrastructure.",
    "Flooding": "Floodwaters can cause moisture ingress into sensitive electronics and control cabinets. Underground control rooms, conduits, and other components are also vulnerable to flooding. Even if de-energised, floodwater can damage and corrode electrical devices, contacts, terminals, and high-cost online monitors. In free-breathing equipment, high floodwaters may reach breathers, allowing moisture to enter. Finally, lack of preventive measures can lead to costly repairs and delay power restoration after the floodwaters recede.",
    "Wildfires": "Wildfires pose a direct risk to power transformers if the wildfires are near the substation. High heat and fire itself would damage or destroy: 1) power transformers, 2) associated components such as bushings, load tap changers, cooling apparatus, control cabinets, instrument transformers, and protection devices, and 3) other substation components. Smoke from nearby wildfires can deposit on external insulating surfaces of bushings and arrestors, resulting in arcing and discharges and posing a flashover risk. Smoke can include compounds that are corrosive in nature, deteriorating paint, and metal surfaces. Finally, wildfires can interrupt feedback to the grid, lead to in expensive cleanups, and cause an overall loss of assets. The greater frequency of wildfires is already rising costs for transformer setups in some regions because of the need to upgrade to fireproof or fire-resistant equipment. In addition to the risk posed by wildfires, the need to take more aggressive fire prevention measures in times of severe drought can significantly increase maintenance expenses and necessitate costly modifications and upgrades to mitigate any potential risk of ignition."
    },
"Overhead transmission systems": {
    "Temperature": "The temperature limits for these systems are determined by the conductors themselves. Rising global air temperatures lead to more frequent temperature extremes and higher nighttime lows, increasing electricity demand for cooling during warm seasons. As power companies look to enhance the capacity of existing transmission lines, the operating temperatures will rise due to increased electrical loads, particularly without voltage upgrades. Ambient temperature increases also contribute to higher conductor temperatures. Extreme cold can impact short spans, where conductor sag is minimal. In these cases, thermal contraction of the suspended conductors is transferred to the hardware fittings and structure attachment points, potentially causing stress at these connection points.",
    "Frozen precipitation": "Ice accumulation can overload structures, stressing conductors, tower members, and other components. Ice accumulation happens when liquid precipitation is near freezing, meaning the heaviest ice loads aren’t always in the coldest regions. As temperatures rise in traditionally colder areas, extreme ice events could shift geographically. Overhead line failures have also been linked to avalanches caused by heavy snowfall, depending on geography and terrain.",
    "Wind speeds and directions": "Failures often result from localised wind effects (topography and terrain roughness) not accounted for in original designs. Long-term winds can cause cyclic loading, weakening structural components like fasteners and connections, leading to failure.",
    "Wildfires": "Wildfire risk is influenced by both meteorological conditions, such as air temperature, humidity, and precipitation, and human activities like forest management and recreation in wildfire-prone areas. Overhead power lines are particularly relevant, as they are vulnerable to wildfires, which can disrupt air insulation, and they may also serve as ignition sources. Drier regions are increasingly at risk for wildfires due to changing climate conditions."
    },
"Underground transmission systems": {
    "Temperature": "The ratings of underground transmission lines are influenced by changes in ambient and soil temperatures, as well as soil moisture levels. High air and soil temperatures, coupled with low soil moisture—especially during prolonged droughts—can decrease the ampacity of these lines when moisture levels fall below design specifications. Corrosion of underground components is affected by air temperature, soil temperature, humidity, precipitation, and soil moisture content. Components such as buried steel pipes, metallic supports in vaults, and terminal parts are particularly at risk. Increased temperatures and prolonged wet conditions, including those resulting from rising sea levels, can accelerate corrosion rates and shorten the lifespan of these components if they lack adequate protection."
