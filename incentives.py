    "incentive": "Recommendation 8 - Align Laws and Define Renewable Energy Valleys",
    "explanation": "Incentives alone cannot solve this deeper issue. National authorities should review and align existing laws that affect energy, land use, cooperatives, and local governance. A clear legal definition of Renewable Energy Valleys (REVs) is needed, along with simple rules for how citizens and communities can participate.  Crete could serve as a pilot region to test how permits, roles, and responsibilities can be better coordinated.

    "incentive": "Recommendation 9 - Fast-Track Permits for Small-Scale REVs",
    "explanation": "Community energy projects in Greece face the same permitting and licensing rules as large commercial actors. Authorities should create a separate fast-track procedure for small-scale, citizen-led REVs, including simplified documentation, and exemption thresholds.

    "incentive": "Recommendation 10 - Reintroduce Targeted Incentives for Communities",
    "explanation": "This is a core regulatory and financial gap that incentives alone cannot tackle. Although Greece transposed the EU definitions of energy communities, the regulatory framework still lacks dedicated support. National authorities should go beyond legal definitions and re-establish targeted incentives energy communities.",
